    "\n",
    "### What we are building\n",
    "We'll build a model to do NER on an open source MIT Movie Dataset. We will continue to apply our learning philosophy of repetition as we build multiple models of increasing complexity in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple model to get a baseline\n",
    "1. RNN based model\n",
    "1. Using LSTM. Does it do better? \n",
    "1. Using Stacked LSTMs\n",
    "1. **Extension**: Explore different parameters, features, and metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "###  Evaluation\n",
    "We will evaluate our models along the following two dimensions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accuracy: the ratio of the number of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances. \n",
    "1. F1: since this is a multi-class classification problem, we'll add these metrics to each of the runs using the relevant functions from torchmetrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We've provide scaffolding for all the boiler plate Pytorch code to get to our baseline model. This covers downloading and parsing the dataset, and training code for the baseline model. **Make sure to read all the steps and internalize what is happening**.\n",
    "1. At this point, our model gets to an accuracy of about 0.78. After this we'll try to improve the model by using RNNs and LSTMs. **Does this improve accuracy?**\n",
    "1. In the next set of models, we'll stack the LSTM cells and see if they can boost up our model. **How do you think this model will perform?**\n",
    "1. **Extension**: We have suggested a bunch of extensions to the project so go crazy! Tweak any parts of the pipeline, and see if you can beat all the current modes.\n",
